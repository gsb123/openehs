## Mission ##
[Korle Bu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korle_Bu_Teaching_Hospital), the primary health facility in Ghana, Africa, currently uses paper processes for managing information. Some forms of this information are patient records, billing, and the management of the inventory of drugs and supplies.

We propose to create an Electronic Healthcare System (EHS) that maintains a limited medical history of each patient, manages an inventory of pharmaceuticals, generates reports for administrators and improves communication between physicians, nurses, and staff. With this system, the process of seeing each patient will be accelerated, communication errors reduced and the overall quality of service to patients will be improved.

While this project is currently being developed for one of the major teaching hospitals in Ghana, Africa it is not limited to that facility. The plan for the project is to provide this type of system for other hospitals in need.
